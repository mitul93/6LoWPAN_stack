####Using this code
-----------------------

Thank you for your time to read this. This is not complete project. Project is completed, but many files were lost unfortunately. This repo is merely to show the stack configuration and frame formate of IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN standard.

Anyway to know about the outcome of this project refer [IEEE application paper](http://grouper.ieee.org/sa/sec/public/nsf_grant/Student%20Application%20Papers/Mohit%20Agarwal/Final%20Paper/WirelessEnergyMonitoring6LoWPAN_final.pdf) published by contributors.
